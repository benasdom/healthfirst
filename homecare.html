IELTS Academic can be taken in a test centre on paper or on computer, and can now also be taken online from home or another private location that has a stable internet connection. IELTS General Training can only be taken in a test centre on paper or on computer.

                    For Academic and General Training you take the same Listening and Speaking tests but different Reading and Writing tests. Make sure you prepare for the correct test type.
                    
                    The Listening, Reading and Writing sections of all IELTS tests are completed on the same day, with no breaks in between them.
                    
                    The Speaking test, however, may be scheduled up to a week before or after the other tests. If you booked IELTS Online, your Speaking test will usually take place before your other tests. The total test time is 2 hours and 45 minutes.
